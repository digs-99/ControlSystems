# ControlSystems
CSU 2019-2020 IREC Control Systems Modules

This repository aims to contain the main Control System.
Each file acts as a header file to communicate between Sensors and a main logic board (Raspberry Pi linux based).
The Brain.py file acts as our main executable which calls the header files and formats their data into outputs on a GPIO pin.
